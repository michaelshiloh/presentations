Introduction to Arduino
- What is a microcontroller?
	- A small computer designed to be a controller in some system
- What does this mean?
	- Designed to make it easy to connect sensors and output devices like LEDs,
		to control devices like motor controllers or controllable LED panels, and
		to interface to more complex devices like radios.
- What must a microcontroller have?
	- Many flexible ways to connect to things (we call them *pins*)
	- Some way to store and run a program
	- Some sort of programming environment which makes it easy to write
		programs for the microcontroller and to load them into the microcontroller
- Arduino is just one of many microcontrollers, but it is perhaps the easiest
	to get started with and is extremely popular with students, hobbyists, and
	experimentors. There are a great many books, tutorials (video and written), 
	and example projects available

Here is something I built this morning to show you
